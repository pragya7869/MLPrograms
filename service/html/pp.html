Solar power (also knows as solar radiation or insolation) is energy from the sun.

This energy, in the form of heat and light, supports all life on Earth, drives the Earth's climate and weather and is predominately responsible for the class of resources collectively known as renewable energy.

Solar power is the conversion of energy from sunlight into electricity, either directly using photovoltaics (PV), indirectly using concentrated solar power, or a combination. Concentrated solar power systems use lenses or mirrors and tracking systems to focus a large area of sunlight into a small beam. Photovoltaic cells convert light into an electric current using the photovoltaic effect.[1]

Artificial Intelligence is a way of making a computer, a computer-controlled robot, or a software think intelligently, in the similar manner the intelligent humans think.

AI (artificial intelligence) is the simulation of human intelligence processes by machines, especially computer systems. These processes include learning (the acquisition of information and rules for using the information), reasoning (using the rules to reach approximate or definite conclusions) and self-correction.

Artificial intelligence (AI) is an area of computer science that emphasizes the creation of intelligent machines that work and react like humans. 

Artificial intelligence is a branch of computer science that aims to create intelligent machines. It has become an essential part of the technology industry. 
Amnesty International has proved that it can revolutionize energy. This sector is already dependent on improvements and forecasts: energy production, balance of energy balances and consumption habits.

Abstract
Artificial intelligence (AI) techniques play an important role in modeling, analysis, and prediction of the performance and control of renewable energy. The algorithms employed to model, control, or to predict performances of the energy systems are complicated involving differential equations, large computer power, and time requirements. Instead of complex rules and mathematical routines, AI techniques are able to learn the key information patterns within a multidimensional information domain. Design, control, and operation of solar energy systems require long-term series of meteorological data such as solar radiation, temperature, or wind data. Such long-term measurements are often non-existent for most of the interest locations or, wherever they are available, they suffer of a number of shortcomings (e.g. poor quality of data, insufficient long series, etc.). To overcome these problems AI techniques appear to be one of the strongest candidates. This paper provides an overview of commonly used AI methodologies in solar energy, with a special emphasis on neural networks, fuzzy logic, and genetic algorithms. Selected AI applications to solar energy are outlined in this chapter. In particular, methods using the AI approach for the following applications are discussed: prediction and modeling of solar radiation, seizing, performances, and controls of the solar photovoltaic (PV) systems.
